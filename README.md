# KickStarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover fundraising campaign trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client Louise wants an analysis on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  This project will analyze the Kickstarter Campaign data and generate insights into how different variables influence the campaign outcome, based on their launch dates and their funding goals.  These findings will be presented using charts and graphs to provide Louise (our client) with essential information at glance, improve understanding of campaign factors, ability to communicate fundraising insights in a constructive manner and finally analyze the latest campaign trends. Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. N

### Purpose
To achieve optimal fundraising campaigns based on historical:
•	Goal setting amounts for fundraising campaigns
•	Launch date set for fundraising campaigns
To provide as mentioned earlier visual feedback to aide Louise in establishing realistic campaign goals, setting the ideal launch date, and location for her Kickstarter campaign for her upcoming play Fever.

## Analysis and Challenges
On the spreadsheet "Parent Category Outcomes", data analysis resulted:
•	Theater category is the most successful, followed by music and film&video.
•	Food, games, publishing, and photography have very low rates of success. Journalism has a zero rate of success as all the journalism campaigns have been cancelled.

On the spreadsheet "Subcategory Outcomes", data analysis resulted:
•	Plays subcategory is the most successful, followed by rock, documentary, indie rock and hardware.

So Louise’s last choice to do a play "Fever" was the correct category for the fundraising campaign.

On the "Descriptive Statistics" tab, one can clearly visualize, that failed campaigns have much higher goals than successful campaigns (10.5k versus 5k).  
That the current "live" campaigns are asking on average 10.8k which is twice as much than the average successful goal

The chart labeled "Subcategory Plays - Mean Goal versus Mean Pledged" is a good visualization tool to further explain to staff the importance in setting realistic goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line graph labeled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" offers great insights in terms of optimal Launch Date:
•	May and June are the best months to launch a campaign (based on historical data)
•	October and December are the worst months to launch a campaign (based on historical data)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Observing the analysis done on the tab labeled "Outcome Based on Goals" we can conclude that smaller amounts up to 15 thousand have a high success rate (i.e, % Successful line crosses with the % Failed line).  Further, there is another pocket of joy right above 35 thousand to 45 thousand.  Any goal setting above 45 thousand has a very high failure rate.  Further investigation might be deemed, but this is a good indication that unrealistic goals should be avoided to maintain a "successful" reputation on the campaign raising business.

On the graph labeled "Subcategory Plays - Mean goal versus Mean pledged".  For successful campaigns, the mean goal and pledged are similar at around 5.6k.  For failed campaigns, the mean goal and mean pledged amounts have a large discrepancy.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The biggest challenge is that the data in this case is that we are only analyzing two factors on a fundraising campaign: "launch dates" and "goal amount setting".  There are more factors behind the failure or success of certain campaigns that we are not analyzing in the scope of this project.  We would need to analyze the backers and see if they are still contributing members. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
•	May and June are the best months to launch a campaign (based on data provided)
•	October and December are the worst months to launch a campaign (based on data provided)
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Observing the analysis done on the tab labeled "Outcome Based on Goals" we can conclude:
•	That smaller amounts up to 15 thousand have a high success rate (i.e, % Successful line crosses with the % Failed line). 
•	Further, there is another pocket of joy right above 35 thousand to 45 thousand.  
•	Any goal setting above 45 thousand has a very high failure rate.  
Further investigation might be deemed, but this is a good indication that unrealistic goals should be avoided to maintain a "successful" reputation on the campaign raising business.	

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
o	Limited data sample size
o	Lack of information of timing and amount donated/pledged in each campaign
o	Lack of data past 1st quarter of 2017 (missing current information)
o	Lack of information on user number of visits to the fundraiser website

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A graph titled "Count of Outcomes by Category" was created on tab "X_Category", to illustrate the point that I have made earlier that:
•	Theater category is the most successful, followed by music and film&video.
•	Food, games, publishing, and photography have very low rates of success. 

New plots and visualization tools could have been created to analyze, campaign length versus goal amount.  Plots could be altered to reflect the amount that was funded, not simply categorize as: successful, failed or canceled. Regression analysis could have been performed as basing our analysis on only two factors, launch date and goal amount setting, probably do not explain the full picture.  Plots and graphs on backers count, staff pick, spotlight might generate some further insight into campaigning.
